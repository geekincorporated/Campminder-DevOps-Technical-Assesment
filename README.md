## DevOps Azure Challenge
Time to complete: Please do as much as you can of this project in ~60 minutes.
Goal: Our goal in this challenge is to engage with your thought process instead of
collecting a simple pass/fail metric. In a subsequent interview, we will have time for you to
share more about how this challenge went for you and the decisions you made.
Tools: Even if you have never used Azure, it’s very similar to AWS so don’t worry, we’re just
hoping you’re able to search and identify the name of the equivalent tool in Azure for the
purposes of this exercise.

### Challenge:
Rough out an architecture diagram of an n-tier application on Azure and write a
summary (up to 1 page) describing your choices.
The scalable, fault-tolerant design should support these workloads:
- A collection of containerized microservices
- A JS static frontend
- A MySQL or SQL Server tier Additionally, the following considerations should be factored into your design:
- Minimization of operational overhead
- Cost Optimization
- Make the best use of distributed solutions
- Address network fundamentals to support the design
- Consider frameworks/techniques used for automation (configuration management,deployments, pipelines,...)
- The target SLA to achieve is 99,9% (It must be based on Microsoft documentation)
- Take into account how the Monitoring and Observability would be achieved for the solution

### Deliverable: 
We are expecting you to submit an architecture diagram of the deployment on
Azure, as well as a summary describing the architectures and detailing the pros/cons of the
decisions made.
